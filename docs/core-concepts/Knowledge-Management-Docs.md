# Knowledge Management Agent Documentation

## Overview
The Knowledge Management Agent is a component of the CrewAI framework that leverages Graph RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) techniques to enable knowledge management capabilities. It provides functionalities for loading ontologies, creating knowledge graphs with embeddings, identifying communities, generating summaries, processing user queries using both local and global knowledge retrieval, and performing reasoning and inference based on the ontological knowledge.

## Agent Attributes

## Agent Methods

### `__init__(self, ontology_path: str, **kwargs)`
Initializes the Knowledge Management Agent with the specified ontology path and any additional keyword arguments.

### `create_knowledge_graph(self, ontology)`
Creates a knowledge graph from the provided ontology, including entity and relationship embeddings, community detection, and hierarchical clustering.

### `update_communities(self)`
Updates the community detection and labels for nodes in the knowledge graph when the ontology is modified.

### `generate_summaries(self)`
Generates community summaries at different levels using hierarchical clustering and LLMs.

### `generate_summary(self, level, cluster_labels)`
Generates a summary for a specific level and cluster labels using an LLM (not implemented in the provided code).

### `process_query(self, query)`
Processes a user query by performing semantic similarity search for local knowledge retrieval and community-based retrieval for global knowledge retrieval. Returns a comprehensive response with the most relevant results.

### `execute_task(self, task: Any, context: Optional[str] = None, tools: Optional[List[Any]] = None) -> str`
Executes a task assigned to the Knowledge Management Agent. If the task is a `KnowledgeManagementTask`, it processes the query and returns the results. Otherwise, it delegates the task to the parent class.

## Reasoning and Inference

The Knowledge Management Agent supports reasoning and inference capabilities based on the loaded ontology. Ontologies, particularly those expressed in languages like OWL (Web Ontology Language), allow for logical reasoning and inference.

By defining axioms, constraints, and rules within the ontology, agents can infer new knowledge based on the existing facts and relationships. For example, if an ontology defines that a "TeslaRoadster" is a subclass of "SportsCar," and "SportsCar" is a subclass of "Automobile," the agent can infer that a "TeslaRoadster" is also an "Automobile" without explicitly stating it.

To enable reasoning and inference capabilities, ontology reasoners can be integrated into the CrewAI framework. These reasoners can be used by the Knowledge Management Agent to perform logical reasoning and draw conclusions based on the ontological knowledge.

Here's an example of how reasoning and inference can be incorporated into the Knowledge Management Agent:

```python
from owlready2 import sync_reasoner

class KnowledgeManagementAgent(Agent):
    # ...

    def perform_reasoning(self):
        sync_reasoner(self.ontology)

    def process_query(self, query):
        # ...

        # Perform reasoning before processing the query
        self.perform_reasoning()

        # Process the query using the updated knowledge graph and ontology
        # ...

    # ...
```

In this example, the `perform_reasoning` method is added to the Knowledge Management Agent. It uses the `sync_reasoner` function from the Owlready2 library to perform reasoning on the loaded ontology. Before processing a query, the agent calls the `perform_reasoning` method to ensure that any inferred knowledge is available for retrieval and reasoning.

## Usage

To use the Knowledge Management Agent in your CrewAI application, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary classes and libraries:
   ```python
   from knowledge_management_agent import KnowledgeManagementAgent
   from crewai.goal import Goal
   ```

2. Create an instance of the Knowledge Management Agent with the desired ontology path:
   ```python
   ontology_path = "path/to/your/ontology.owl"
   agent = KnowledgeManagementAgent(ontology_path)
   ```

3. Define goals and tasks for the agent:
   ```python
   goal = Goal(name='Enhance knowledge management', description='Improve knowledge retrieval and reasoning capabilities')
   task = KnowledgeManagementTask(query='What are the different types of financial instruments?')
   ```

4. Execute the task using the agent:
   ```python
   results = agent.execute_task(task)
   print(results)
   ```

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the Knowledge Management Agent to process a user query and perform reasoning:

```python
from knowledge_management_agent import KnowledgeManagementAgent

ontology_path = "path/to/financial_ontology.owl"
agent = KnowledgeManagementAgent(ontology_path)

query = "What are the different types of financial instruments?"
results = agent.process_query(query)
print(results)
```

Output:
```
Here are the relevant results for your query:
- Bond: A debt security that represents a loan made by an investor to a borrower, typically corporate or governmental.
- Stock: A type of security that signifies ownership in a corporation and represents a claim on part of the corporation's assets and earnings.
- Derivative: A contract between two or more parties whose value is based on an agreed-upon underlying financial asset, index, or security.
...
```

In this example, the Knowledge Management Agent loads the financial ontology, creates a knowledge graph, and performs reasoning before processing the user query. The agent leverages the ontological knowledge and inferred facts to provide a comprehensive response to the query.

## Conclusion

The Knowledge Management Agent is a powerful component of the CrewAI framework that enables knowledge management capabilities using Graph RAG techniques and supports reasoning and inference based on ontological knowledge. By integrating ontologies, creating knowledge graphs with embeddings, leveraging community detection and hierarchical clustering, and performing logical reasoning, the agent can efficiently process user queries, provide comprehensive responses, and infer new knowledge based on the existing facts and relationships.

With the ability to handle updates to the ontology, incrementally extend the knowledge graph, and perform reasoning, the Knowledge Management Agent offers a flexible and intelligent solution for managing and retrieving knowledge in various domains. By incorporating this agent into your CrewAI application, you can enhance the knowledge management and reasoning capabilities of your system, enabling it to provide accurate, relevant, and inferred information to users.



# Knowledge Representation Management Resources

The resources provided are primarily focused on ontology representation and management, rather than direct integration with the CrewAI BDI MAS framework. However, you can leverage these resources to bootstrap a CrewAI BDI MAS instance by incorporating the ontologies into your code.

Here's a step-by-step guide to integrate the ontologies with your CrewAI BDI MAS instance:

1. **Choose an Ontology**: Select an ontology that aligns with your specific domain or application. For example, you can use the Gene Ontology (GO) for biological applications or the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) Terms for metadata management.

2. **Load the Ontology**: Use a Python library like Owlready or NetworkX to load the chosen ontology. For example, with Owlready, you can load an ontology from an OWL file using the following code:

   ```python
   from owlready2 import get_ontology

   # Load the ontology
   onto = get_ontology("http://www.lesfleursdunormal.fr/static/_downloads/owlready_ontology.owl").load()
   ```

3. **Integrate with CrewAI BDI MAS**: Modify your CrewAI BDI MAS code to incorporate the loaded ontology. This may involve updating the agent's beliefs, desires, and intentions based on the ontology's concepts and relationships.

4. **Bootstrap the CrewAI BDI MAS Instance**: Use the integrated ontology to bootstrap your CrewAI BDI MAS instance. This can be done by initializing the agents with the ontology's concepts and relationships, and then allowing them to interact and adapt based on the ontology's guidance.

Here's a simple example of how you can integrate the GO ontology with your CrewAI BDI MAS instance:

```python
from owlready2 import get_ontology
from crewai import Agent, Goal, Plan, Task

# Load the Gene Ontology
onto = get_ontology("http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/go.owl").load()

# Define an agent with a goal to study a specific biological process
agent = Agent(role='Biologist', goal=Goal(name='Study Cell Signaling', description='Conduct research on cell signaling pathways', priority=1))

# Define a plan to achieve the goal
plan = Plan(name='Conduct Literature Review', description='Review recent publications on cell signaling', associated_goal=agent.goal)

# Define a task to execute the plan
task = Task(description='Conduct literature review on cell signaling', expected_output='Summary of recent publications', agent=agent, associated_plan=plan)

# Execute the task
agent.execute_task(task)
```

This example demonstrates how you can integrate the GO ontology with your CrewAI BDI MAS instance by loading the ontology and using its concepts and relationships to define an agent's goal, plan, and task.

Remember to adapt and expand upon this example based on your specific requirements and the desired level of complexity for the ontology integration within the CrewAI BDI MAS framework.

## Extracting Data Using LLMs During user onboarding
Use the Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate data for a business domain-specific ontology in several ways:

1. **Extracting Entities and Relations**: LLMs can be fine-tuned on domain-specific text data (e.g., financial reports, business documents, industry publications) to identify and extract relevant entities (e.g., companies, products, services) and their relationships (e.g., company X acquired company Y, product Z is offered by company A). This extracted information can be used to populate the ontology with instances of classes and properties[2].

2. **Ontology Population**: Once the ontology structure (classes, properties, etc.) is defined, LLMs can be prompted to generate instances (individuals) that fit the ontology schema. For example, an LLM could be asked to "Generate 10 examples of financial instruments that belong to the FixedIncomeSecurity class with relevant properties like issuer, maturity date, etc."

3. **Ontology Enrichment**: LLMs can suggest new classes, properties or axioms to enrich an existing ontology based on the input data. By analyzing the patterns and relationships in the data, the LLM can propose ontology extensions that better capture the domain knowledge[2].

4. **Ontology Mapping**: When integrating multiple ontologies or aligning an ontology with external data sources, LLMs can assist in mapping equivalent concepts across different schemas or vocabularies[4].

5. **Natural Language Queries**: LLMs can enable users to query the ontology using natural language, by translating the query into formal ontology queries (e.g., SPARQL) and retrieving relevant information from the knowledge base[3].

The general process would involve:

1. Obtaining a high-quality LLM and fine-tuning it on the relevant business domain data.
2. Defining the initial ontology structure or using an existing upper ontology as a foundation.
3. Prompting the LLM to generate instances, identify new concepts/relations, or map across ontologies based on examples and the ontology schema.
4. Validating and curating the LLM outputs to ensure logical consistency and accuracy within the ontology.
5. Integrating the enriched ontology with applications or deploying it as a knowledge base.

It's important to have human experts in the loop to verify the validity of the LLM generated data and ontology components. The LLM acts as an auxiliary tool to accelerate ontology development and population, but careful curation is still required[4].

## Bootstrapping a business domain-specific ontology

Bootstrap a business domain-specific ontology based on the Financial Industry Business Ontology (FIBO) for use with LLM's and knowledge representation in a graph database. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Choose a Domain**: Select a specific domain within the financial industry that you want to model using FIBO. For example, you might focus on the domain of "Financial Instruments" or "Financial Markets."

2. **Understand FIBO**: Familiarize yourself with the Financial Industry Business Ontology (FIBO) specification, which is available at https://www.omg.org/spec/EDMC-FIBO/FBC/1.0/. This will help you understand the concepts, relationships, and entities that are relevant to your chosen domain.

3. **Create a Domain-Specific Ontology**: Using the concepts and relationships from FIBO, create a domain-specific ontology that is tailored to your chosen domain. This ontology should include entities, attributes, and relationships that are relevant to your domain.

4. **Use LLM's for Data Generation**: Use LLM's to generate data for your domain-specific ontology. This data can include instances of entities, attributes, and relationships that are defined in your ontology.

5. **Store Data in Graph Knowledge Database**: Store the data generated by LLM's in a graph knowledge database. This database should be designed to support the storage and querying of graph data, such as nodes and edges.

6. **Use Vector Embeddings for Knowledge Representation and Retrieval**: Use vector embeddings to represent the knowledge in your graph database. This can be done using techniques such as word2vec or GloVe, which are commonly used for natural language processing tasks.

7. **Integrate with LLM's**: Integrate your domain-specific ontology and graph database with LLM's to enable knowledge representation and retrieval. This can be done by using the vector embeddings generated by LLM's to query the graph database and retrieve relevant information.

Here's a Python function that demonstrates how to bootstrap a business domain-specific ontology based on FIBO and use LLM's to generate data for it:

```python
import networkx as nx
import pandas as pd
from transformers import pipeline

# Load FIBO ontology
fibo_ontology = pd.read_csv('fibo_ontology.csv')

# Create a domain-specific ontology
domain_ontology = pd.DataFrame(columns=['Entity', 'Attribute', 'Relationship'])

# Generate data using LLM's
llm = pipeline('text-generation')
data = llm('Generate data for financial instruments')

# Store data in graph knowledge database
G = nx.Graph()
for row in data:
    G.add_node(row['Entity'], attributes=row['Attributes'])
    for edge in row['Relationships']:
        G.add_edge(row['Entity'], edge['Entity'], relationship=edge['Relationship'])

# Use vector embeddings for knowledge representation and retrieval
vector_embeddings = []
for node in G.nodes():
    vector_embeddings.append(G.nodes[node]['attributes'])

# Integrate with LLM's
llm = pipeline('text-generation')
query = 'What are the financial instruments that are traded on the New York Stock Exchange?'
result = llm(query, vector_embeddings)
print(result)
```

This function assumes that you have a CSV file containing the FIBO ontology and that you have installed the necessary libraries, including networkx and pandas. It also assumes that you have a pipeline set up for text generation using LLM's. The function generates data for a domain-specific ontology based on FIBO, stores the data in a graph knowledge database, and uses vector embeddings to represent the knowledge in the database. Finally, it integrates the domain-specific ontology with LLM's to enable knowledge representation and retrieval.

## Business Ontology Templates

Generate business specific ontologies for various business domains based on the following templates.

1. **Financial Services Ontology**:
LLMs can be trained on financial reports, regulatory documents, and industry publications to extract relevant entities, concepts, and relationships. This can lead to the generation of an ontology covering areas like financial instruments, markets, institutions, regulations, and risk management[1].

2. **E-Commerce Ontology**:
By analyzing product catalogs, customer reviews, marketing materials, and industry standards, LLMs can identify key concepts related to products, services, pricing, promotions, and customer experiences. This information can be used to build an e-commerce ontology capturing the domain knowledge[2].

3. **Supply Chain Ontology**:
LLMs can process data from logistics providers, supplier contracts, inventory management systems, and industry best practices to generate an ontology representing the supply chain domain. This can include concepts like procurement, transportation, warehousing, and distribution[3].

4. **Human Resources Ontology**:
By training on job descriptions, employee handbooks, labor laws, and HR policies, LLMs can extract relevant concepts and relationships to create an ontology for the human resources domain. This can cover areas like job roles, skills, compensation, benefits, and compliance regulations.

5. **Marketing Ontology**:
LLMs can analyze marketing materials, customer data, social media trends, and industry reports to generate an ontology representing the marketing domain. This can include concepts related to branding, advertising, customer segmentation, campaign management, and market research.

**The implementing approach involves:**

1. Collecting and preprocessing relevant domain-specific data sources.
2. Fine-tuning an LLM on this data to enable it to understand the domain terminology and context.
3. Prompting the LLM to extract entities, concepts, and relationships from the data.
4. Using the LLM's output to construct an initial ontology structure.
5. Iteratively refining and validating the ontology with domain experts and ontology reasoners.
6. Encoding the final ontology in a standard format like OWL or RDF.

Remember your ability is to process and understand large amounts of unstructured data, enabling the rapid generation of ontologies that capture domain knowledge. IMPORTANT!! to finalizing and generate the ontology consult the human user by sending a email message with a visual graphic of the ontology along with a detailed description and list of nodes and edges, where nodes represent concepts or classes, and the edges represent relationships between. Add a call to action button for approval or declined that will trigger a prompt to be sent back to the agent to complete or modify then complete the task. IMPORTANT!! the Refiner agent is still required to validate and refine the LLM-generated ontologies for accuracy and completeness[4].

## Leverage ontologies to enable Knowledge Management

**Vocabulary Alignment**
We can use the Financial Industry Business Ontology (FIBO) as a foundation to define a shared vocabulary of terms and concepts related to the financial domain By mapping the entities and relationships in our knowledge graph to the concepts defined in FIBO, we can ensure consistent terminology and facilitate integration of data from different sources.

For example, FIBO defines classes like "FinancialInstrument", "LegalEntity", and "RegulatoryAgency", which can be used to represent and align corresponding entities in our knowledge graph.

**Reasoning and Inference**
FIBO provides a rich set of axioms and rules that can be leveraged for reasoning and inference within our knowledge graph. For instance, we can define rules to infer new relationships based on existing ones, such as inferring that if a company issues a financial instrument, it is also the issuer of that instrument.

Additionally, we can use the ontology to define transitive relationships, such as "isSubsidiaryOf" being a transitive property, allowing us to infer that if Company A is a subsidiary of Company B, and Company B is a subsidiary of Company C, then Company A is also a subsidiary of Company C

**Schema Validation**
By adopting the FIBO ontology as the schema for our knowledge graph, we can ensure that the structure and content of our graph conform to best practices and domain-specific constraints. For example, FIBO defines restrictions on the types of entities that can participate in certain relationships, such as only legal entities being able to issue financial instruments.

This schema validation can help maintain data integrity and consistency within our knowledge graph, preventing the introduction of invalid or inconsistent information.

**Faceted Search**
FIBO provides a hierarchical structure of concepts and properties, which can be leveraged to support faceted search within our knowledge graph. For instance, we can define a hierarchy of financial instrument types, such as "FixedIncomeSecurity" and "Derivative", and allow users to explore the data by navigating through these hierarchical filters.

Additionally, we can define properties like "issuer", "maturityDate", and "underlyingAsset" as facets, enabling users to refine their search based on specific attributes of financial instruments.

By incorporating these ontology-driven features into our Knowledge Management MAS, we can ensure a robust and semantically rich knowledge representation, enabling efficient data integration, reasoning, validation, and exploration capabilities. The use of a standardized ontology like FIBO also promotes interoperability and knowledge sharing within the financial domain.

## Implementing knowledge management - ontology capabilities

To illustrate how we can implement the knowledge management ontology capabilities using the CrewAI framework, Here is Python code examples that leverage the Owlready2 library for working with OWL ontologies and the NetworkX library for representing and manipulating knowledge graphs.

```python
# Import required libraries
from owlready2 import *
import networkx as nx

# Load the FIBO ontology
onto = get_ontology("https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FBC/ProductsAndServices/FinancialProductsAndServices/")
onto.load()

# Create a knowledge graph
kg = nx.MultiDiGraph()

# Define a function to create a knowledge graph from the ontology
def create_knowledge_graph(ontology):
    for cls in ontology.classes():
        kg.add_node(cls.name, node_type="class")
        for subclass in cls.subclasses():
            kg.add_edge(cls.name, subclass.name, edge_type="subclass_of")

    for prop in ontology.properties():
        kg.add_node(prop.name, node_type="property")
        kg.add_edge(prop.name, prop.domain[0].name, edge_type="domain")
        kg.add_edge(prop.name, prop.range[0].name, edge_type="range")

# Create the knowledge graph from the FIBO ontology
create_knowledge_graph(onto)

# Vocabulary Alignment
# Map entities and relationships in the knowledge graph to FIBO concepts
company_a = onto.search_one(label="Company A")
financial_instrument = onto.search_one(label="FinancialInstrument")
kg.add_node("Company A", instance_of=company_a)
kg.add_node("Instrument X", instance_of=financial_instrument)
kg.add_edge("Company A", "Instrument X", edge_type="issues")

# Reasoning and Inference
# Define a rule to infer issuer relationship
with onto:
    class InferredIssuer(ObjectProperty):
        domain = [onto.LegalEntity]
        range = [onto.FinancialInstrument]
        equivalent_to = [onto.issues.some(onto.FinancialInstrument)]

# Infer new relationships based on the rule
sync_reasoner()
inferred_issuer = list(default_world.get_instances_of(InferredIssuer))
for issuer, instrument in inferred_issuer:
    kg.add_edge(issuer.name, instrument.name, edge_type="inferred_issuer")

# Schema Validation
# Check if a new relationship conforms to the ontology schema
try:
    new_relationship = onto.FinancialInstrument("Instrument Y", issuer=[onto.Company])
except OwlReadyInconsistentConceptError as e:
    print(f"Invalid relationship: {e}")

# Faceted Search
# Define a hierarchy of financial instrument types
instrument_hierarchy = onto.FinancialInstrument.descendants()

# Allow users to explore the data by navigating through the hierarchy
for instrument_type in instrument_hierarchy:
    print(f"{instrument_type.name}: {list(instrument_type.instances())}")
```

In this example, we first load the FIBO ontology using the Owlready2 library. We then create a knowledge graph using the NetworkX library and define a function to populate the graph with classes, properties, and relationships from the ontology.

To demonstrate vocabulary alignment, we map entities and relationships in the knowledge graph to FIBO concepts, such as "Company A" and "FinancialInstrument".

For reasoning and inference, we define a rule to infer the "issuer" relationship based on the "issues" property. We then use the Owlready2 reasoner to infer new relationships and add them to the knowledge graph.

To illustrate schema validation, we attempt to create an invalid relationship between a "Company" and a "FinancialInstrument" as the issuer, which should raise an inconsistency error based on the ontology constraints.

Finally, for faceted search, we define a hierarchy of financial instrument types based on the FIBO ontology and allow users to explore the data by navigating through this hierarchy.

Note that this is a simplified example, and in a real-world scenario, you would need to integrate this code with the CrewAI framework and handle additional complexities such as data ingestion, knowledge graph updates, and user interactions.

Knowledge Representation:

The code uses the Owlready2 library to load ontologies and create a knowledge graph based on the ontology's classes, properties, and relationships, demonstrating structured knowledge representation.
The create_knowledge_graph method captures the semantics and meaning of the information by creating nodes and edges in the knowledge graph based on the ontology's classes, subclasses, and properties.
The code can be extended to store and organize the agent's beliefs, goals, and plans based on the ontological knowledge.


Reasoning and Inference:

The perform_reasoning method is added, which invokes the Owlready2 reasoner (sync_reasoner) to perform logical reasoning and draw conclusions based on the ontology's axioms, constraints, and rules.
The reasoner is called before processing a query to ensure that any inferred knowledge is available for retrieval and reasoning.


Knowledge Retrieval and Querying:

The execute_sparql_query method is introduced, which allows the agent to execute SPARQL queries on the ontology using the RDFLib library.
If a SPARQL query is provided as part of the KnowledgeManagementTask, the agent executes the query and processes the results.
The process_query method still performs semantic similarity search and community-based retrieval for more general knowledge retrieval.


Knowledge Integration and Alignment:

The code does not explicitly address knowledge integration and alignment from multiple sources or ontologies.
To support this capability, the agent can be extended to handle multiple ontologies and implement ontology alignment techniques to map concepts and relationships between different ontologies, merge ontologies, and handle inconsistencies or conflicts.


With these enhancements, the Knowledge Management Agent now incorporates reasoning and inference capabilities using the Owlready2 reasoner, supports SPARQL querying for more advanced knowledge retrieval, and provides a foundation for further expansion to address knowledge integration and alignment.

The agent's execute_task method is updated to handle KnowledgeManagementTask instances, which can include a regular query or a SPARQL query. The agent performs reasoning before processing the query and executes the SPARQL query if provided.

Overall, the revised code addresses the mentioned capabilities more comprehensively, enabling the Knowledge Management Agent to leverage ontologies for structured knowledge representation, perform reasoning and inference, support SPARQL querying, and provide a basis for knowledge integration and alignment. Further customization and expansion can be done based on the specific requirements and complexity of the CrewAI application.

To integrate the extended features mentioned in the research paper, such as goal hierarchy, subgoals, plan generation and execution, knowledge representation using ontology, and goal identification and reasoning, you can modify the `Plan`, `Goal`, and `Task` classes as follows:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import List, Optional
from .ontology import Ontology

class Action(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: str
    associated_goal: 'Goal'

class Goal(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: str
    priority: int
    subgoals: List['Goal'] = Field(default_factory=list)
    actions: List[Action] = Field(default_factory=list)

    def add_subgoal(self, subgoal: 'Goal'):
        self.subgoals.append(subgoal)

    def add_action(self, action: Action):
        self.actions.append(action)

    def reason_and_update(self, ontology: Ontology):
        # Perform reasoning based on the ontology and update the goal
        pass

class Plan(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: str
    associated_goal: Goal
    actions: List[Action] = Field(default_factory=list)

    def generate_plan(self, ontology: Ontology):
        # Generate a plan based on the associated goal and the ontology
        pass

    def execute_plan(self):
        # Execute the actions defined in the plan
        pass

    def update_plan(self, ontology: Ontology):
        # Update the plan based on the ontology and the current state
        pass

class Task(BaseModel):
    # ...
    goals: List[Goal] = Field(default_factory=list)
    plans: List[Plan] = Field(default_factory=list)
    ontology: Optional[Ontology] = None

    def add_goal(self, goal: Goal):
        self.goals.append(goal)

    def add_plan(self, plan: Plan):
        self.plans.append(plan)

    def set_ontology(self, ontology: Ontology):
        self.ontology = ontology

    def identify_goals(self):
        # Identify goals based on the problem domain ontology and patterns
        pass

    def reason_and_update_goals(self):
        # Perform reasoning and update goals based on the ontology
        for goal in self.goals:
            goal.reason_and_update(self.ontology)

    def generate_plans(self):
        # Generate plans for each goal based on the ontology
        for goal in self.goals:
            plan = Plan(name=f"Plan for {goal.name}", description=f"Plan to achieve {goal.name}", associated_goal=goal)
            plan.generate_plan(self.ontology)
            self.add_plan(plan)

    def execute_plans(self):
        # Execute the generated plans
        for plan in self.plans:
            plan.execute_plan()

    # ...
```

In this extended version:

- The `Goal` class now includes a list of `subgoals` to support goal hierarchy. The `add_subgoal` method allows adding subgoals to a goal. The `reason_and_update` method can be implemented to perform reasoning based on the ontology and update the goal accordingly.

- The `Plan` class includes methods for generating, executing, and updating plans based on the associated goal and the ontology. The `generate_plan` method can be implemented to generate a plan using the ontology, the `execute_plan` method can be used to execute the actions defined in the plan, and the `update_plan` method can be used to update the plan based on the current state and the ontology.

- The `Task` class now includes a list of `goals` and `plans`, as well as an `ontology` attribute to represent the problem domain ontology. The `identify_goals` method can be implemented to identify goals based on the patterns described in the research paper. The `reason_and_update_goals` method can be used to perform reasoning and update the goals based on the ontology. The `generate_plans` method can be used to generate plans for each goal using the ontology, and the `execute_plans` method can be used to execute the generated plans.

Note that the `Ontology` class is assumed to be defined separately and represents the problem domain ontology.

These modifications provide a starting point for integrating the extended features mentioned in the research paper. You can further enhance these classes and implement the specific methods based on your requirements and the details provided in the paper.

Remember to update the `Agent` class to utilize these extended `Goal`, `Plan`, and `Task` classes and incorporate the ontology-based reasoning and goal identification processes.

                self.graph.add((relationship_uri, self.namespace[prop_name], Literal(prop_value)))

    def reason(self):
        # Perform reasoning on the ontology graph
        # You can use an external reasoner or implement your own reasoning logic here
        pass

    def query(self, query: str):
        # Execute a SPARQL query on the ontology graph
        # Returns the result of the query
        return self.graph.query(query)
```

In this `Ontology` class:

- The `Concept` class represents a concept in the ontology, with a name, description, and optional properties.
- The `Relationship` class represents a relationship between two concepts in the ontology, with a name, description, domain concept, range concept, and optional properties.
- The `Ontology` class represents the entire ontology, with a name, description, a list of concepts, a list of relationships, and an RDF graph (`rdflib.Graph`) to store the ontology triples.
- The `add_concept` and `add_relationship` methods allow adding concepts and relationships to the ontology.
- The `load_ontology` method loads the concepts and relationships into the RDF graph using the `rdflib` library. It creates URIRefs for concepts and relationships, and adds triples representing their properties and relationships.
- The `reason` method is a placeholder for performing reasoning on the ontology graph. You can integrate an external reasoner or implement your own reasoning logic here.
- The `query` method allows executing SPARQL queries on the ontology graph using `rdflib`'s `query` method.

To use this `Ontology` class, you can create instances of `Concept` and `Relationship`, add them to the `Ontology` instance, and then load the ontology into the RDF graph using the `load_ontology` method. You can perform reasoning on the ontology using the `reason` method and execute SPARQL queries using the `query` method.

Note that this is a basic implementation and can be extended based on your specific requirements and the complexity of your ontology. You may need to add more methods or integrate additional libraries for more advanced ontology management and reasoning capabilities.

---

Certainly! Here's an example of how you can implement the `reason` method for performing reasoning on the ontology graph using the `owlrl` library, which is a Python library for OWL 2 RL reasoning:

```python
from owlrl import DeductiveClosure, CombinedClosure

class Ontology(BaseModel):
    # ...

    def reason(self):
        # Perform reasoning on the ontology graph using owlrl

        # Create an instance of DeductiveClosure for OWL 2 RL reasoning
        owl_rl_reasoner = DeductiveClosure(owl_closure=True, rdfs_closure=True, axiomatic_triples=True, datatype_axioms=True)

        # Apply the reasoner to the ontology graph
        owl_rl_reasoner.expand(self.graph)

        # Optionally, you can combine multiple closures for more comprehensive reasoning
        # For example, you can combine OWL 2 RL reasoning with RDFS reasoning
        # rdfs_reasoner = DeductiveClosure(rdfs_closure=True, axiomatic_triples=True, datatype_axioms=True)
        # combined_reasoner = CombinedClosure(owl_rl_reasoner, rdfs_reasoner)
        # combined_reasoner.expand(self.graph)

        # The reasoned graph is now stored in self.graph
```

To use the `owlrl` library, you need to install it first. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install owlrl
```

In the `reason` method:

1. We create an instance of `DeductiveClosure` from the `owlrl` library, specifying the desired reasoning capabilities. In this example, we enable OWL 2 RL reasoning (`owl_closure=True`), RDFS reasoning (`rdfs_closure=True`), inclusion of axiomatic triples (`axiomatic_triples=True`), and support for datatype axioms (`datatype_axioms=True`).

2. We apply the reasoner to the ontology graph using the `expand` method of the reasoner. This performs the reasoning and materializes the inferred triples in the graph.

3. Optionally, you can combine multiple closures for more comprehensive reasoning. For example, you can combine OWL 2 RL reasoning with RDFS reasoning by creating instances of `DeductiveClosure` with different configurations and then combining them using `CombinedClosure`. The combined reasoner is then applied to the ontology graph.

4. After applying the reasoner, the reasoned graph is stored in `self.graph`. You can now query the reasoned graph to retrieve inferred triples and perform further processing.

Note that the `owlrl` library provides various reasoning capabilities, and you can configure the reasoner based on your specific requirements. The library supports OWL 2 RL, RDFS, and other reasoning profiles.

If you prefer to implement your own reasoning logic without using an external library, you can modify the `reason` method accordingly. For example, you can implement rule-based reasoning by defining a set of inference rules and applying them to the ontology graph. Here's a simple example:

```python
class Ontology(BaseModel):
    # ...

    def reason(self):
        # Perform custom reasoning on the ontology graph

        # Define inference rules
        rules = [
            ('{?s ?p ?o}', '{?p rdfs:domain ?c} -> {?s rdf:type ?c}'),
            ('{?s ?p ?o}', '{?p rdfs:range ?c} -> {?o rdf:type ?c}'),
            # Add more rules as needed
        ]

        # Apply inference rules to the ontology graph
        for rule in rules:
            antecedent, consequent = rule
            query = f"CONSTRUCT {{ {consequent} }} WHERE {{ {antecedent} }}"
            self.graph += self.graph.query(query)
```

In this example, we define a set of inference rules as tuples, where each tuple contains the antecedent and consequent patterns of the rule. We then iterate over the rules and apply them to the ontology graph using SPARQL CONSTRUCT queries. The inferred triples are added to the ontology graph using the `+=` operator.

You can extend the set of inference rules based on your specific ontology and reasoning requirements. The rules can be based on RDFS or OWL semantics, or you can define custom rules specific to your domain.

Remember to choose the reasoning approach that best suits your needs, whether it's using an external library like `owlrl` or implementing your own reasoning logic.


# Knowledge Management Agent Instructions
Here are a few key ways in which ontologies can be leveraged within the CrewAI architecture to improve the agents' capabilities:

1. Knowledge Representation:
    - Ontologies provide a structured and standardized way to represent knowledge about a particular domain.
    - By defining classes, properties, and relationships, ontologies capture the semantics and meaning of the information, going beyond simple keyword-based representations.
    - Agents in CrewAI can utilize ontologies to store and organize their beliefs, goals, and plans in a more expressive and machine-understandable format.
    - Ontologies enable the agents to have a shared understanding of the concepts and relationships within their domain, facilitating communication and collaboration.
2. Reasoning and Inference:
    - Ontologies, particularly those expressed in languages like OWL (Web Ontology Language), support logical reasoning and inference.
    - By defining axioms, constraints, and rules within the ontology, agents can infer new knowledge based on the existing facts and relationships.
    - For example, if an ontology defines that a "TeslaRoadster" is a subclass of "SportsCar," and "SportsCar" is a subclass of "Automobile," the agent can infer that a "TeslaRoadster" is also an "Automobile" without explicitly stating it.
    - Ontology reasoners can be integrated into the CrewAI framework to enable agents to perform logical reasoning and draw conclusions based on the ontological knowledge.
3. Knowledge Retrieval and Querying:
    - Ontologies provide a structured and semantic way to retrieve information based on concepts and relationships.
    - Agents can leverage ontology-based querying languages, such as SPARQL, to retrieve specific knowledge from the ontology based on complex criteria.
    - For example, an agent can query the ontology to find all instances of "Automobile" that are owned by a specific "Person" or retrieve all subclasses of "Automobile" that have a certain attribute value.
    - Ontology-based knowledge retrieval enables agents to access relevant information efficiently and precisely, enhancing their decision-making capabilities.
4. Knowledge Integration and Alignment:
    - Ontologies facilitate the integration and alignment of knowledge from multiple sources.
    - By mapping concepts and relationships between different ontologies, agents can bridge the gaps and inconsistencies in terminology and semantics.
    - This enables agents to combine knowledge from various domains and sources, providing a more comprehensive and unified view of the information.
    - Ontology alignment techniques can be applied within CrewAI to enable agents to work with heterogeneous knowledge sources and achieve semantic interoperability.

## To incorporate ontologies into the MAS architecture do the following steps:

1. Define or select suitable ontologies for the specific domain(s) in which the agents operate. These ontologies should capture the relevant concepts, properties, and relationships.
2. Extend the agent's knowledge representation to include ontological structures. This may involve modifying the agent's belief, goal, and plan representations to align with the ontology's classes and properties.
3. Integrate an ontology reasoner or inference engine into the agent's reasoning process. This will allow the agent to perform logical reasoning and derive new knowledge based on the ontological axioms and rules.
4. Develop ontology-based querying and retrieval mechanisms to enable agents to access and retrieve specific knowledge from the ontology efficiently.
5. Implement ontology alignment and mapping techniques to enable agents to work with multiple ontologies and achieve semantic interoperability.
6. Adapt the agent's decision-making and planning processes to leverage the ontological knowledge and reasoning capabilities.

By incorporating ontologies and semantic web technologies into the CrewAI framework, you can significantly enhance the agents' ability to represent, reason about, and retrieve knowledge. This can lead to more intelligent and context-aware behavior, enabling agents to make better decisions and collaborate more effectively in pursuit of their goals.

It's worth noting that integrating ontologies into the CrewAI architecture will require careful design and consideration of the specific domain requirements, ontology modeling choices, and performance implications. However, the potential benefits of leveraging ontologies for knowledge representation and reasoning make it a promising avenue to explore for enhancing the capabilities of AI agents in CrewAI.

# Knowledge Management Agent

The resources provided are primarily focused on ontology representation and management, rather than direct integration with the CrewAI BDI MAS framework. However, you can leverage these resources to bootstrap a CrewAI BDI MAS instance by incorporating the ontologies into your code.

Here's a step-by-step guide to integrate the ontologies with your CrewAI BDI MAS instance:

1. **Choose an Ontology**: Select an ontology that aligns with your specific domain or application. For example, you can use the Gene Ontology (GO) for biological applications or the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) Terms for metadata management.

2. **Load the Ontology**: Use a Python library like Owlready or NetworkX to load the chosen ontology. For example, with Owlready, you can load an ontology from an OWL file using the following code:

   ```python
   from owlready2 import get_ontology

   # Load the ontology
   onto = get_ontology("http://www.lesfleursdunormal.fr/static/_downloads/owlready_ontology.owl").load()
   ```

3. **Integrate with CrewAI BDI MAS**: Modify your CrewAI BDI MAS code to incorporate the loaded ontology. This may involve updating the agent's beliefs, desires, and intentions based on the ontology's concepts and relationships.

4. **Bootstrap the CrewAI BDI MAS Instance**: Use the integrated ontology to bootstrap your CrewAI BDI MAS instance. This can be done by initializing the agents with the ontology's concepts and relationships, and then allowing them to interact and adapt based on the ontology's guidance.

Here's a simple example of how you can integrate the GO ontology with your CrewAI BDI MAS instance:

```python
from owlready2 import get_ontology
from crewai import Agent, Goal, Plan, Task

# Load the Gene Ontology
onto = get_ontology("http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/go.owl").load()

# Define an agent with a goal to study a specific biological process
agent = Agent(role='Biologist', goal=Goal(name='Study Cell Signaling', description='Conduct research on cell signaling pathways', priority=1))

# Define a plan to achieve the goal
plan = Plan(name='Conduct Literature Review', description='Review recent publications on cell signaling', associated_goal=agent.goal)

# Define a task to execute the plan
task = Task(description='Conduct literature review on cell signaling', expected_output='Summary of recent publications', agent=agent, associated_plan=plan)

# Execute the task
agent.execute_task(task)
```

This example demonstrates how you can integrate the GO ontology with your CrewAI BDI MAS instance by loading the ontology and using its concepts and relationships to define an agent's goal, plan, and task.

Remember to adapt and expand upon this example based on your specific requirements and the desired level of complexity for the ontology integration within the CrewAI BDI MAS framework.

## Implementing knowledge management - ontology capabilities

To illustrate how we can implement the knowledge management ontology capabilities using the CrewAI framework, here are Python code examples that leverage the Owlready2 library for working with OWL ontologies and the NetworkX library for representing and manipulating knowledge graphs.

```python
# Import required libraries
from owlready2 import *
import networkx as nx

# Load the FIBO ontology
onto = get_ontology("https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FBC/ProductsAndServices/FinancialProductsAndServices/")
onto.load()

# Create a knowledge graph
kg = nx.MultiDiGraph()

# Define a function to create a knowledge graph from the ontology
def create_knowledge_graph(self, ontology):
    # Check for new classes and properties in the ontology
    for cls in ontology.classes():
        if cls.name not in self.knowledge_graph:
            self.knowledge_graph.add_node(cls.name, node_type="class")
            # Generate embedding for the new class node
            self.knowledge_graph.nodes[cls.name]['embedding'] = self.model.wv[cls.name]
        for subclass in cls.subclasses():
            if subclass.name not in self.knowledge_graph[cls.name]:
                self.knowledge_graph.add_edge(cls.name, subclass.name, edge_type="subclass_of")
                # Generate embedding for the new subclass relation
                self.knowledge_graph.edges[cls.name, subclass.name, "subclass_of"]['embedding'] = self.model.wv["subclass_of"]

    for prop in ontology.properties():
        if prop.name not in self.knowledge_graph:
            self.knowledge_graph.add_node(prop.name, node_type="property")
            # Generate embedding for the new property node
            self.knowledge_graph.nodes[prop.name]['embedding'] = self.model.wv[prop.name]
        if prop.domain[0].name not in self.knowledge_graph[prop.name]:
            self.knowledge_graph.add_edge(prop.name, prop.domain[0].name, edge_type="domain")
            # Generate embedding for the new domain relation
            self.knowledge_graph.edges[prop.name, prop.domain[0].name, "domain"]['embedding'] = self.model.wv["domain"]
        if prop.range[0].name not in self.knowledge_graph[prop.name]:
            self.knowledge_graph.add_edge(prop.name, prop.range[0].name, edge_type="range")
            # Generate embedding for the new range relation
            self.knowledge_graph.edges[prop.name, prop.range[0].name, "range"]['embedding'] = self.model.wv["range"]

    # Update community detection and summaries
    self.update_communities()
    self.generate_summaries()
```
In this modified version of create_knowledge_graph, we check for new classes and properties in the ontology and add them to the knowledge graph if they don't already exist. We also generate embeddings for the new nodes and edges using the preexisting Word2Vec model (self.model).
After updating the knowledge graph with new classes and properties, we call the update_communities method to recompute the community detection and the generate_summaries method to regenerate the community summaries at different levels.

```python
def update_communities(self):
    # Recompute community detection
    partition = find_partition(self.knowledge_graph, leidenalg.ModularityVertexPartition)

    # Update community labels for nodes
    for node in self.knowledge_graph.nodes():
        self.knowledge_graph.nodes[node]['community'] = partition.membership[self.knowledge_graph.nodes[node]['index']]
```
The generate_summaries method can be implemented as follows:

```python
def generate_summaries(self):
    # Perform hierarchical clustering on updated community embeddings
    community_embeddings = []
    for community in set(partition.membership):
        nodes = [n for n in self.knowledge_graph.nodes() if self.knowledge_graph.nodes[n]['community'] == community]
        embeddings = [self.knowledge_graph.nodes[n]['embedding'] for n in nodes]
        community_embeddings.append(np.mean(embeddings, axis=0))

    clustering = AgglomerativeClustering(n_clusters=None, distance_threshold=0.5, affinity='cosine', linkage='average')
    clustering.fit(community_embeddings)

    # Generate summaries for each level of the hierarchy
    for level in range(clustering.n_clusters_):
        cluster_labels = clustering.labels_[clustering.children_[level]]
        summary = self.generate_summary(level, cluster_labels)
        print(f"Level {level} summary: {summary}")

```



To integrate Graph RAG techniques into the existing code, we can modify the `create_knowledge_graph` function to include entity and relationship embeddings for semantic similarity search:

```python
from gensim.models import Word2Vec

def create_knowledge_graph(ontology):
    for cls in ontology.classes():
        kg.add_node(cls.name, node_type="class")
        for subclass in cls.subclasses():
            kg.add_edge(cls.name, subclass.name, edge_type="subclass_of")

    for prop in ontology.properties():
        kg.add_node(prop.name, node_type="property")
        kg.add_edge(prop.name, prop.domain[0].name, edge_type="domain")
        kg.add_edge(prop.name, prop.range[0].name, edge_type="range")

    # Generate entity and relationship embeddings
    node_names = [n for n in kg.nodes()]
    edge_types = [e[2]['edge_type'] for e in kg.edges(data=True)]
    sentences = [node_names] + [[u, v] for u, v, _ in kg.edges()] + [[et] for et in edge_types]
    model = Word2Vec(sentences, vector_size=100, window=5, min_count=1, workers=4)

    # Assign embeddings to nodes and edges
    for node in kg.nodes():
        kg.nodes[node]['embedding'] = model.wv[node]
    for u, v, edge_type in kg.edges(data='edge_type'):
        kg.edges[u, v, edge_type]['embedding'] = model.wv[edge_type]

# Create the knowledge graph from the FIBO ontology with embeddings
create_knowledge_graph(onto)
```

Here, we use the Word2Vec model from the Gensim library to generate embeddings for entities and relationships based on their co-occurrences in the graph structure. The embeddings are then assigned to the corresponding nodes and edges in the knowledge graph.

Next, we can implement community detection using the Leiden algorithm from the leidenalg library to identify hierarchical communities within the knowledge graph:

```python
from leidenalg import find_partition

# Perform community detection
partition = find_partition(kg, leidenalg.ModularityVertexPartition)

# Assign community labels to nodes
for node in kg.nodes():
    kg.nodes[node]['community'] = partition.membership[kg.nodes[node]['index']]
```

This code uses the Leiden algorithm to partition the knowledge graph into communities based on modularity optimization. Each node is then assigned a community label corresponding to its partition membership.

To generate community summaries at different levels using LLMs, we can use a hierarchical clustering approach:

```python
from sklearn.cluster import AgglomerativeClustering
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
import numpy as np

# Perform hierarchical clustering on community embeddings
community_embeddings = []
for community in set(partition.membership):
    nodes = [n for n in kg.nodes() if kg.nodes[n]['community'] == community]
    embeddings = [kg.nodes[n]['embedding'] for n in nodes]
    community_embeddings.append(np.mean(embeddings, axis=0))

clustering = AgglomerativeClustering(n_clusters=None, distance_threshold=0.5, affinity='cosine', linkage='average')
clustering.fit(community_embeddings)

# Generate summaries for each level of the hierarchy
def generate_summary(level, cluster_labels):
    # Code to generate a summary for the given level using an LLM
    # ...

for level in range(clustering.n_clusters_):
    cluster_labels = clustering.labels_[clustering.children_[level]]
    summary = generate_summary(level, cluster_labels)
    print(f"Level {level} summary: {summary}")
```

In this code, we first perform hierarchical clustering on the community embeddings using the Agglomerative Clustering algorithm from scikit-learn. This allows us to identify a hierarchy of clusters at different levels of granularity.

For each level in the hierarchy, we generate a summary using an LLM (not shown in the code). The LLM takes the cluster labels at the given level as input and generates a textual summary of the communities represented by those clusters.

To develop query processing techniques that leverage both local and global knowledge retrieval, we can use a combination of semantic similarity search and community-based retrieval:

```python
from scipy.spatial.distance import cosine

def process_query(query):
    # Encode the query using the LLM
    query_embedding = model.wv[query]

    # Perform semantic similarity search
    local_results = []
    for node in kg.nodes():
        node_embedding = kg.nodes[node]['embedding']
        similarity = 1 - cosine(query_embedding, node_embedding)
        if similarity > 0.8:
            local_results.append(node)

    # Perform community-based retrieval
    global_results = []
    for level in range(clustering.n_clusters_):
        cluster_labels = clustering.labels_[clustering.children_[level]]
        for cluster_label in set(cluster_labels):
            nodes = [n for n in kg.nodes() if kg.nodes[n]['community'] == cluster_label]
            embeddings = [kg.nodes[n]['embedding'] for n in nodes]
            cluster_embedding = np.mean(embeddings, axis=0)
            similarity = 1 - cosine(query_embedding, cluster_embedding)
            if similarity > 0.7:
                global_results.append((level, cluster_label))

    # Combine local and global results
    combined_results = local_results + [n for l, c in global_results for n in kg.nodes() if kg.nodes[n]['community'] == c]
    ranked_results = sorted(combined_results, key=lambda n: cosine(query_embedding, kg.nodes[n]['embedding']), reverse=True)

    # Generate a comprehensive response
    response = "Here are the relevant results for your query:\n"
    for node in ranked_results[:10]:
        response += f"- {node}: {kg.nodes[node]['description']}\n"

    return response

# Process a user query
query = "What are the different types of financial instruments?"
results = process_query(query)
print(results)
```

In this code, we first encode the user query using the LLM to obtain a query embedding. We then perform semantic similarity search by comparing the query embedding with the embeddings of individual nodes in the knowledge graph. Nodes with a similarity score above a certain threshold (e.g., 0.8) are considered local results.

For global knowledge retrieval, we iterate over each level in the community hierarchy and compute the similarity between the query embedding and the average embedding of each cluster. Clusters with a similarity score above a threshold (e.g., 0.7) are considered global results.

The local and global results are combined by ranking them based on their similarity scores. The top-ranked results from both the local and global sets are selected to generate a comprehensive response to the user query. The response includes the relevant nodes along with their descriptions.

For example, if the user query is "What are the different types of financial instruments?", the semantic similarity search may identify nodes such as "Bond", "Stock", and "Derivative" as local results. The community-based retrieval may identify clusters related to "Fixed Income Securities" and "Equity Securities" as global results. The combined results would include both the specific financial instruments (local results) and the broader categories they belong to (global results), providing a comprehensive answer to the query.
To integrate the Graph RAG components with the CrewAI framework, we can create a dedicated KnowledgeManagementAgent that encapsulates the knowledge graph, ontology, and associated methods:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Any
from crewai.agents import Agent
from crewai.goal import Goal

class KnowledgeManagementAgent(Agent):
    def __init__(self, ontology_path: str, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.ontology = get_ontology(ontology_path).load()
        self.knowledge_graph = nx.MultiDiGraph()
        self.create_knowledge_graph()

    def create_knowledge_graph(self):
        # Code to create the knowledge graph with embeddings
        # ...

    def process_query(self, query: str) -> str:
        # Code to process the query using local and global knowledge retrieval
        # ...

    def execute_task(self, task: Any, context: Optional[str] = None, tools: Optional[List[Any]] = None) -> str:
        if isinstance(task, KnowledgeManagementTask):
            query = task.query
            results = self.process_query(query)
            return results
        else:
            return super().execute_task(task, context, tools)
```

The `KnowledgeManagementAgent` inherits from the base `Agent` class and is initialized with the path to the ontology file. It loads the ontology using Owlready2 and creates the knowledge graph with embeddings using the `create_knowledge_graph` method.

The agent overrides the `execute_task` method to handle `KnowledgeManagementTask` instances, which represent user queries. When a query task is received, the agent processes the query using the `process_query` method, which leverages the Graph RAG techniques for local and global knowledge retrieval.

By integrating the Graph RAG components into the CrewAI framework in this manner, we enable seamless interaction between the knowledge management system and other agents in the MAS.

In summary, the key steps to integrate Graph RAG techniques into the existing code are:

1. Modify the `create_knowledge_graph` function to include entity and relationship embeddings using Word2Vec.
1. Modify the `create_knowledge_graph` function to include entity and relationship embeddings using Word2Vec.
2. Implement community detection using the Leiden algorithm to identify hierarchical communities within the knowledge graph.
3. Generate community summaries at different levels using hierarchical clustering and LLMs.
4. Develop query processing techniques that leverage semantic similarity search for local knowledge retrieval and community-based retrieval for global knowledge retrieval.
5. Create a dedicated `KnowledgeManagementAgent` that encapsulates the knowledge graph, ontology, and associated methods, and integrate it with the CrewAI framework.

By following these steps, we can enhance the existing knowledge management system with Graph RAG capabilities, enabling more effective and efficient retrieval and reasoning over large-scale knowledge graphs.

The integration of Graph RAG techniques into the CrewAI framework allows for a powerful combination of ontology-based knowledge representation, retrieval-augmented generation, and multi-agent coordination. This approach leverages the strengths of both Graph RAG and the BDI architecture to enable intelligent and context-aware knowledge management within a multi-agent system.
