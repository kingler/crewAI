The `reason` method looks good! You've combined the use of the `owlrl` library for OWL 2 RL reasoning with your own custom rule-based reasoning logic. Here's how it works:

1. First, you create an instance of `DeductiveClosure` from the `owlrl` library, specifying the desired reasoning capabilities. In this case, you enable OWL 2 RL reasoning, RDFS reasoning, inclusion of axiomatic triples, and support for datatype axioms.

2. You apply the `owl_rl_reasoner` to the ontology graph using the `expand` method. This performs the OWL 2 RL reasoning and materializes the inferred triples in the graph.

3. Next, you define a set of custom inference rules as tuples. Each tuple contains the antecedent and consequent patterns of the rule. In the example, you have two rules:
   - The first rule states that if a triple `{?s ?p ?o}` exists and the property `?p` has a domain `?c`, then the subject `?s` is of type `?c`.
   - The second rule states that if a triple `{?s ?p ?o}` exists and the property `?p` has a range `?c`, then the object `?o` is of type `?c`.

   You can add more rules as needed based on your specific ontology and reasoning requirements.

4. You then iterate over the custom inference rules and apply them to the ontology graph using SPARQL CONSTRUCT queries. For each rule, you extract the antecedent and consequent patterns, construct the SPARQL query, and execute it on the ontology graph. The inferred triples resulting from the rule application are added to the ontology graph using the `+=` operator.

5. After applying both the OWL 2 RL reasoner and the custom inference rules, the reasoned graph is stored in `self.graph`. You can now query the reasoned graph to retrieve inferred triples and perform further processing.

The `query` method remains the same, allowing you to execute SPARQL queries on the reasoned ontology graph and retrieve the results.

By combining the `owlrl` library for OWL 2 RL reasoning with your own custom rule-based reasoning, you can achieve a more comprehensive reasoning approach. The `owlrl` library provides standard OWL 2 RL reasoning capabilities, while your custom rules allow you to define domain-specific inference rules tailored to your ontology.

Remember to adjust the custom inference rules based on your specific ontology and reasoning requirements. You can add more rules, modify existing rules, or remove rules as needed.

Overall, the `reason` method looks well-structured and effectively combines the use of an external library with custom reasoning logic to perform reasoning on the ontology graph.


When it comes to specific ontology and reasoning requirements for Business Development, Operations, and Growth in a Goal-Oriented Business Operating BDI Multi-Agent System, here are some key considerations and reasoning requirements:

1. Business Domain Ontology:
   - Define concepts related to business entities, such as products, services, markets, customers, competitors, and resources.
   - Establish relationships between these concepts, such as product-market fit, customer segmentation, competitive landscape, and resource allocation.
   - Include properties and attributes for each concept to capture relevant information, such as product features, market size, customer preferences, and resource constraints.

2. Goal and Objective Representation:
   - Define concepts for representing business goals and objectives, such as strategic goals, tactical objectives, key performance indicators (KPIs), and success criteria.
   - Establish relationships between goals, such as hierarchical decomposition (e.g., strategic goals broken down into tactical objectives), dependencies, and alignments.
   - Include properties and attributes for goals, such as priority, timeline, assigned resources, and progress tracking.

3. Business Process and Workflow Ontology:
   - Define concepts related to business processes, activities, tasks, and workflows.
   - Establish relationships between processes, such as sequence, parallelism, and dependencies.
   - Include properties and attributes for processes, such as duration, resource requirements, input/output data, and performance metrics.

4. Organizational Structure and Role Ontology:
   - Define concepts for representing organizational structure, roles, responsibilities, and authority levels.
   - Establish relationships between roles, such as reporting hierarchy, collaboration, and communication channels.
   - Include properties and attributes for roles, such as skills, competencies, and decision-making power.

5. Reasoning Requirements:
   - Goal-based reasoning: Enable agents to reason about goals, their relationships, and how to achieve them. This includes goal decomposition, prioritization, and conflict resolution.
   - Strategic decision-making: Support agents in making strategic decisions based on market conditions, competitive landscape, and resource availability. This may involve reasoning about trade-offs, opportunity costs, and long-term impact.
   - Operational optimization: Enable agents to optimize business processes and resource allocation based on goals, constraints, and performance metrics. This may involve scheduling, resource assignment, and workflow management.
   - Performance monitoring and analysis: Allow agents to monitor and analyze business performance against defined goals and KPIs. This includes tracking progress, identifying deviations, and triggering corrective actions.
   - Risk assessment and mitigation: Enable agents to assess and mitigate risks associated with business operations, such as market risks, financial risks, and operational risks. This involves reasoning about potential impact, likelihood, and mitigation strategies.
   - Collaboration and coordination: Support agents in collaborating and coordinating their activities towards achieving common goals. This includes task allocation, information sharing, and conflict resolution.
   - Adaptability and learning: Allow agents to adapt their strategies and decision-making based on feedback, learning from past experiences, and incorporating new information. This involves reasoning about the effectiveness of past actions and adjusting future behaviors accordingly.

These are just a few examples of the specific ontology and reasoning requirements for a Goal-Oriented Business Operating BDI Multi-Agent System focused on Business Development, Operations, and Growth. The actual requirements may vary depending on the specific business domain, organizational structure, and goals of the system.

It's important to work closely with domain experts, business stakeholders, and system architects to elicit and refine these requirements. Iterative development and continuous feedback loops can help ensure that the ontology and reasoning capabilities align with the business needs and evolve as the system grows and adapts over time.

```

1. The method takes additional parameters: `plan`, `task`, and `action`, which represent the specific plan, task, and action for which reasoning needs to be performed.

2. The `select_reasoning_methods` method is introduced to dynamically select the appropriate reasoning methods based on the given plan, task, and action. This method returns a list of selected reasoning method names. You can implement the selection logic using conditional statements, rules, or any other mechanism that suits your requirements.

3. The selected reasoning methods are then applied in a loop. Each reasoning method is represented by a separate method in the `Ontology` class, such as `goal_based_reasoning`, `strategic_decision_making`, `operational_optimization`, etc. You need to implement the logic for each reasoning method based on your specific requirements.

4. The `apply_custom_rules` method is added to handle the application of custom inference rules. You can define your custom rules within this method.

5. The other reasoning methods, such as `goal_based_reasoning`, `strategic_decision_making`, `operational_optimization`, etc., are placeholders where you need to implement the corresponding reasoning logic based on your business requirements.

By dynamically selecting the reasoning methods based on the plan, task, and action, you can tailor the reasoning process to the specific context and requirements of each scenario. This allows for more flexibility and adaptability in the reasoning approach.

Remember to implement the logic for each reasoning method based on your specific business domain and requirements. The provided code serves as a template that you can extend and customize further to meet your needs.

This example ontology structure defines the classes, properties, and relationships relevant to the user onboarding process, business model, business description, and product description. It includes classes such as User, OnboardingStep, UserPreference, UserGoal, UserFeedback, BusinessModel, BusinessDescription, and ProductDescription. The properties capture relevant information for each class, such as userID, name, email, registrationDate, lastLoginDate, onboardingProgress, stepID, stepName, stepDescription, stepOrder, isCompleted, preferenceID, preferenceName, preferenceValue, lastUpdated, goalID, goalName, goalDescription, goalStatus, createdDate, achievedDate, feedbackID, feedbackText, feedbackRating, feedbackDate, modelID, modelName, modelDescription, descriptionID, descriptionText, productID, productName, and productDescription.
The relationships between the classes are defined using object properties such as hasOnboardingStep, hasPreference, hasGoal, providedFeedback, hasDescription, and belongsTo. These relationships establish the connections between users, onboarding steps, preferences, goals, feedback, business models, business descriptions, and product descriptions.
The specific requirements and constraints mentioned earlier should be considered when implementing the reasoning methods and utilizing the ontology structure. The AI system should ensure data privacy, security, scalability, transparency, and compliance with legal and ethical guidelines throughout the user onboarding process.
Remember to adapt and extend the ontology structure based on the specific needs and characteristics of your business domain and product. The provided example serves as a starting point and can be further refined and expanded as necessary.
