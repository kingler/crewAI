## Collaboration Fundamentals
!!! note "Core of Agent Interaction"
    Collaboration in CrewAI with BDI architecture enables agents to share their beliefs, desires, and intentions, facilitating effective coordination and cooperation towards achieving common goals.

- **Belief Sharing**: Agents can communicate their beliefs about the world to other agents, ensuring a shared understanding and enabling informed decision-making.
- **Goal Alignment**: Agents can align their desires and goals to ensure they are working towards compatible objectives.
- **Plan Coordination**: Agents can coordinate their intentions and plans to avoid conflicts and optimize task execution.

## Implementing Collaboration and Delegation
Setting up a crew with BDI agents involves defining their beliefs, desires, and intentions, as well as their roles and capabilities. CrewAI seamlessly manages their interactions, ensuring efficient collaboration and delegation based on their shared mental states.

## Example Scenario
Consider a crew with a researcher agent tasked with data gathering and a writer agent responsible for compiling reports. The researcher agent's beliefs about the data sources and its desire to ensure data accuracy can be shared with the writer agent. The writer agent can then align its goals and intentions accordingly, delegating specific research tasks back to the researcher agent based on its beliefs and capabilities.

## Conclusion
The integration of the BDI architecture into the CrewAI framework enhances agent collaboration by enabling the sharing of beliefs, desires, and intentions. This facilitates effective coordination and delegation, allowing agents to work together towards common objectives while leveraging their individual strengths and expertise.


These updated documents incorporate the BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention) goal-plan agent behavior architecture into the CrewAI framework. The key changes include:

1. Agents now have beliefs, desires, and intentions that guide their behavior and decision-making.
2. Tasks are linked to the agent's goals and plans, ensuring that agents work effectively towards achieving their objectives.
3. Collaboration among agents involves sharing beliefs, aligning desires and goals, and coordinating intentions and plans.
4. Crews are assembled with BDI agents, taking into account their beliefs, desires, and intentions when executing tasks and collaborating.

By integrating the BDI architecture into the CrewAI framework, agents become more autonomous and goal-oriented, enabling them to work collaboratively and adapt their behavior based on their mental states and the shared objectives of the crew.
